# Introduction {#titlepage}

This is the final project of the Finn 6211 class, with the intention of getting comfortable with spot rate data, their relation to yield curve factors, and various hedging strategies.

The instructions for the report can be found [here](./instructions/Hedging_Project_S18.pdf).

An R package has been created to accompany the report. It contains a number of 
helper functions for cleaning data, manipulating the time series, and creating
the hedging strategies. The package is named, `ratekit` and can be found on
Github [here]().

This report was written with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), a
book authoring package for R.
